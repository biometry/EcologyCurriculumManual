title: Welcome to the Ecology Curriculum Manual
permalink: /index.html
---

This is the landing page for an attempt to write a manual for setting up an Ecology Curriculum.

The curriculum itself shall live on Wikipedia, but there are many reasons and discussion to be had, *why* some elements are as they are. The result of these discussions are to be summarised in a manual, and thus here.

For collaboration with versioning, github is a logical starting place.

It is very early days yet, so we'll have to see how this develops. Any input welcome!
