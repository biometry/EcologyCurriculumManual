The aim of this collaborative activity is to devise a globally applicable curriculum for teaching ecological science (Ecology with a capital E) in higher education. The reasoning is provided elsewhere (REF to Dormann & Mello 2022), but the important bit for *this* page is that we need to define what goes in, and what stays out. We need to *transparently* state purpose and logic of our guidelines, how to contribute to the Ecology Curriculum itself. That is the task of this EC Manual.


### Principles of what goes in and what stays out
Ecology textbooks are thick. This is partly because the range of ecological topics is vast, and partly because Ecology is taught through examples and case studies. A curriculum will have to strip this to a bare minimum, following the following principles:

  - **Laws are more important than patterns.** (If more solar radiation leads, in some long causal chain of events, to more species, then the much-observed latitudinal gradient in species richness is "merely" a consequence of the "energy principle". It is the principle that should be taught, and illustrated by the pattern.)
  - **The better understood should have precedence over the less understood.**
  - **Aggregated, higher-level state variables are easier to understand and predict than lower-level ones.**(Plant biomass per km<sup>2</sup> can be well predicted from precipitation and temperature, but plant species identity cannot, as it is contiguous on the species pool of the region.)
  - **Global principles are more relevant than local phenomena and anecdotes.** (Darwin's hawk moth pollinating a long-spurred orchid is a textbook extreme, but is highly non-representative of both pollination specialisation and coevolution. It is thus not relevant for the curriculum.)
  - **Elements included should be evidence-based, not folklore.** ("Invasional meltdown" (Simberloff & Van Holle 1999) is a very catchy phrase and idea, but evidence does not support it as a general feature of introduced species (e.g. Yin et al. 2022).)
  - **The motivation of science is to understand processes in nature. Motivation by problems is engineering.** (While individuals may be personally motivated by applied questions, such as conservation, this is not the motivation for science and hence Ecology in general. Also processes and patterns of no applied value are valid targets of ecological research.)
  - **Purely theoretical approaches should be relegated to optional classes, unless they are required to understand core elements.** (The consequences of functional response of type III for predator-prey dynamics offer little qualitatively new insights of type II. So why teach them *as core element*?)
  - **Applied case studies should be relegated to optional classes, unless as illustration of underlying processes.** (Ecological applications may be very important, e.g. in conservation, agroecology or forestry, but for teaching they would be either motivation or illustration. If a proposed treatment works but cannot be linked back to ecological laws, then what are students to learn from this?)
  - **Language should be value-free and measured.** (Particularly conservation topics may use hyperbolic terms, such as "climate crisis" or "alien species". That is not the language of science, and should be kept to a minimum.)
  - **Kill your darlings.** ([Keep text concise and succinct](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-does-it-mean-to-kill-your-darlings). Avoid reminiscing rambling and historical excursion.)


### Decisions on the level of student courses

BSc = undergraduate or MSc = graduate?


### Quality assurance of contributed links to courses and material


### Open in spirit, but also open in licence?
Making sure that contributed material can be used freely by everyone.

## Theory
Even when relaxing the definition of "law" to allow minor deviations (following Dodds 2009), the question remains, whether Ecology has laws, and whether they are needed. Even if "we don't need no stinking laws" (O'Hara 2005) for ecological science, we here argue that they serve one important point:

  1. Didactically, laws structure the teaching of ecological theory. Introducing them, one by one, will make it easier for the teacher to build up a coherent curriculum, align case studies and methods, define spatial and temporal scales.
  2. (The same applies to ecological research, which is of no immediate concern here.)


Ecological laws, or if you prefer: principles, were defined by different ecologists in the past, in particular with an ecosystem perspective (Odum 1953), a population perspective (Hutchinson 1958), to acknowledge their insufficiency as guidance for Ecology (Lawton 1999, O'Hara 2005), or as starting points and elements for deducing ecological theory (Dobbs 2009, Vellend 2016). The literature discussing these different points is diverse and confusing (and possibly confused: Colyvan & Ginsburg 2003; Travasso-Britto et al. 2021).

For the development of a curriculum, it may be useful to start somewhere and move on from there, following the guiding principles articulated in the introduction. With a more pragmatic definition of "law" (Colyvan & Ginsburg 2003), one can start with the 32 laws proposed by Dobbs (2009). These are organised along a somewhat arbitrary but intuitive gradient of strictness and scale:

  - Foundations
    1. Laws from physics, chemistry and mathematics
    2. Evolution and natural selection
    3. Dominance of *Homo sapiens*
  - Fundamental biological laws
    4. Biological composition
    5. System openness
    6. Recycling rates
  - Physiological constraints of organisms
    7. All organisms die.
    8. Energy requirement
    9. Nutrient cycling requirement
    10. Maximum metabolic rates
    11. Water requirement
    12. Temperature optimum
  - Behaviour of organisms
