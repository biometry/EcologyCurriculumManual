The aim of this collaborative activity is to devise a globally applicable curriculum for teaching ecological science (Ecology with a capital E) in higher education. The reasoning is provided elsewhere (REF to Dormann & Mello 2022), but the important bit for *this* page is that we need to define what goes in, and what stays out. We need to *transparently* state purpose and logic of our guidelines, how to contribute to the Ecology Curriculum itself. That is the task of this EC Manual.


### Principles of what goes in and what stays out
Ecology textbooks are thick. This is partly because the range of ecological topics is vast, and partly because Ecology is taught through examples and case studies. A curriculum will have to strip this to a bare minimum, following the following principles:

  - **Laws are more important than patterns.** (If more solar radiation leads, in some long causal chain of events, to more species, then the much-observed latitudinal gradient in species richness is "merely" a consequence of the "energy principle". It is the principle that should be taught, and illustrated by the pattern.)
  - *The better understood should have precedence over the less understood.*
  - __Aggregated, higher-level state variables are easier to understand and predict than lower-level ones.__ (Plant biomass per km<sup>2</sup> can be well predicted from precipitation and temperature, but plant species identity cannot, as it is contiguous on the species pool of the region.)
  - **Global principles are more relevant than local phenomena and exotic anecdotes.** (Darwin's hawk moth pollinating a long-spurred orchid is a textbook extreme, but is highly non-representative of both pollination specialisation and coevolution. It is thus not relevant for the curriculum.)
  - **Elements included should be evidence-based, not folklore.** ("Invasional meltdown" (Simberloff & Van Holle 1999) is a very catchy phrase and idea, but evidence does not support it as a general feature of introduced species (e.g. Yin et al. 2022).)
  - **Language should be value-free and measured.** (Particularly conservation topics may use hyperbolic terms, such as "climate crisis" or "alien species". That is not the language of science, and should be kept to a minimum.)
  - **Kill your darlings.** ([Keep text concise and succinct](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-does-it-mean-to-kill-your-darlings). Avoid reminiscing rambling and historical excursion.)


### Decisions on the level of student courses

BSc = undergraduate or MSc = graduate?


### Quality assurance of contributed links to courses and material


### Open in spirit, but also open in licence?
Making sure that contributed material can be used freely by everyone.
