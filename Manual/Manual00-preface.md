The aim of this collaborative activity is to devise a globally applicable curriculum for teaching ecological science (Ecology with a capital E) in higher education. The reasoning is provided elsewhere (REF to Dormann & Mello 2022), but the important bit for *this* page is that we need to define what goes in, and what stays out. We need to *transparently* state purpose and logic of our guidelines, how to contribute to the Ecology Curriculum itself. That is the task of this EC Manual.

### What goes in, what stays out?
Ecology textbooks are thick. This is partly because the range of ecological topics is vast, and partly because Ecology is taught through examples and case studies. A curriculum will have to strip this to a bare minimum, following the following ideas:

  - Laws are more important than patterns. (If more solar radiation leads, in some long causal chain of events, to more species, then the much-observed latitudinal gradient in species richness is "merely" a consequence of the "energy principle". It is the principle that should be taught, and illustrated by the pattern.)
  - Aggregated, higher-level state variables are easier to understand and predict than lower-level ones. (Plant biomass per km^2 can be well predicted from precipitation and temperature, but plant species identity cannot, as it is contiguous on the species pool of the region.) 

### Decisions on the level of student courses

BSc = undergraduate or MSc = graduate?

### Quality assurance of contributed links to courses and material

### Open in spirit, but also open in licence?
Making sure that contributed material can be used freely by everyone.

### Definitions

  - concept
  - law: 
  - pattern
