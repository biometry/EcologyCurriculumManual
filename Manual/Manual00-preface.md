The aim of this collaborative activity is to devise a globally applicable curriculum for teaching ecological science (Ecology with a capital E) in higher education. The reasoning is provided elsewhere (REF to Dormann & Mello 2022), but the important bit for *this* page is that we need to define what goes in, and what stays out. We need to *transparently* state purpose and logic of our guidelines, how to contribute to the Ecology Curriculum itself. That is the task of this EC Manual.

### Decisions on the level of student courses

BSc = undergraduate or MSc = graduate?

### Quality assurance of contributed links to courses and material

### Open in spirit, but also open in licence?
Making sure that contributed material can be used freely by everyone.
